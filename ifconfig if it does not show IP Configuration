The command could not be located because '/sbin' is not included in the PATH environment variable




I have a severe problem today: when I type ifconfig it does not show ip configuration on ubuntu 12.04. Can anyone help me on this?

Here is the result of ifconfig:

Command 'ifconfig' is available in '/sbin/ifconfig'
The command could not be located because '/sbin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.
This is most likely caused by the lack of administrative privileges associated with your user account.
ifconfig: command not found


Try this command :

	sudo ln -s /sbin/ifconfig /usr/bin/ifconfig
	
	
	
You can do either of the following:

    Open your ~/.bashrc file and write the following to the end:

    export PATH=$PATH:/sbin

and then do source ~/.bashrc or open a new terminal instance.

    or open your /etc/environment and add /sbin to end of the PATH variable, so that is as follows:

    PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/games:/sbin"
